Some things we probably want to cover

If the trail is already full (ie has 6 moves in it) then the oldest MOVE in the trail is first removed from the trail.
When a MOVE leaves the trail its corresponding encounter is treated as follows:
If it was a Trap it just vanishes without a trace. (yay!)
If it was a Vampire it has matured. (eek!)

SO WE PROBABLY WANT TO KNOW HOW MANY TRAPS AND VAPIRES THERE ARE ON THE MAP

write any thoughts you have
